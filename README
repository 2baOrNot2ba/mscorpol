To install "mscorpol" simply untar the distribution file:

$ tar xf mscorpol_v*.tar

You will need to have casapy installed (on the CEP1: do "use casa").
No further installation is necessary, unless you need the Hamaker model.

If you also want the Hamaker model of the LOFAR elements 
you also have to untar the lofar_element_response.tar file,
(location cep1:/home/carozzi/scripts/mscorpol_dev/lofar_element_response.tar)
then do:

$ cd lofar_element_response
$ make
$ mv ElementResponseMain ../mscorpol/
